Generic game server
===================

Alpha state. For now, I'm just testing ZeroMQ.

Generic Game Server in Ruby using ZeroMQ.
First implementing Dobble (a little game I like),
and then AntBattle maybe (a AI game I like a lot).

The generic game server list games and game tables.
Players can open a table for different type of games, and play.

Developpers just have to write game class and client

Installation
============

Depends on ZeroMQ:
http://www.zeromq.org/

prerequisites:
sudo gem install ffi ffi-rzmq


Usage
=====

each game server is in own directory

# loads the server
ruby main.rb
